# Shock_Detection_IoT_Project

# Overview
In the biomedical and industrial sectors, ensuring the safety and integrity of sensitive products such as medications, vaccines, and other critical supplies is paramount. Environmental conditions like temperature, humidity, and exposure to shocks during transportation can significantly impact the efficacy and safety of these products. To address these challenges, this project leverages the Internet of Things (IoT) to create a robust system for real-time monitoring and shock detection.

The system utilizes sensors such as the **MPU6050 accelerometer** to detect shocks and vibrations, while additional sensors monitor environmental parameters like temperature and humidity. By integrating these sensors with an IoT platform, the system provides real-time tracking and alerts, ensuring that any deviations from optimal conditions are immediately identified and addressed.
